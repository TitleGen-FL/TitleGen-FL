# Code for TitleGen-FL

This is the source code for the paper **"TitleGen-FL: Quality Prediction-based Filter for Automated Issue Title Generation"**.

## Package Requirement

To run this code, some packages are needed as following:
```
opennmt-py >= 1.0.0
pytorch >= 1.3.0
nltk >= 3.4.5
```

## How to prepare the dataset for TitleGen-FL

### The iTAPE dataset(which is used in our paper and of course provided in this project)

This dataset is origined from the paper《Stay professional and efficient: automatically generate titles for your bug reports》, which published in ASE 2020, and you can find the iTAPE dataset in the folder: **"./iTAPE_dataset"**. It is worth noting that the TXT document with".pred" in its name is the title of the corresponding body generated by using the trained iTAPE model, not the file that comes with the iTAPE data set. We provide our trained iTAPE model and you can find it in this path: **"./pre_trained_models/ ITape_step_25000.pt"**. If you need train one new iTAPE model by yourself, you can visit the iTAPE paper project home page on Github.

### If you want to use your own dataset

Follow the format of the dataset in **"./iTAPE_dataset"**.

## How to run the code

Only need to change the path and parameters in the **Main.py**.

### Use our pretrained models
First, copy the model .pkl file you want to use from the folder: **"./pre_trained_models"** and paste it into the folder: **"./done_model"**.
Second, follow the annotation, change the content in list **"model_names"**, and change the first parameter of function **"DL_component_bleu_threshold"** to **'use'**.
Third, run the Main.py and get final results in the folder: **"./result_last"**.

Train new models
First, follow the annotation, change the content in list "model_names" into the model name you want(we provide five choices: **'CNN', 'RNN', 'RCNN', 'RNN_Attention', 'Transformer'**), and change the first parameter of function **"DL_component_bleu_threshold"** to **'train'**.
Second, run the **Main.py** and get final results in the folder: **"./result_last"**.
